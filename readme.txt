The number one marketplace plugin for WooCommerce.  Now you can allow anyone to open a store on your WooCommerce site!

== Description ==
Create your own marketplace and allow vendors to sell just like etsy, Envato, eBay, or Amazon type sites! This allows other sellers/vendors to sell tangible products, virtual products, or downloads on your site. With this plugin, your vendors receive commissions you set on products they sell from your store.

WC Vendors Marketplace was released to the market in October of 2014 having gotten its roots from Product Vendors by Matt Gates dating back to 2011. We are the number one multi vendor marketplace plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce. It is the most feature packed free plugin available for operating a WooCommerce based multi vendor store.

== Announcements ==

* The plugin name has been updated. It is now called WC Vendors Marketplace. <a href="www.wcvendors.com/2018/07/wc-vendors-marketplace/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=news">Read about it here</a>.
* Questions about GDPR and WC Vendors Marketplace? Please read our recent blog post <a href="https://www.wcvendors.com/2018/05/gdpr-and-wc-vendors/?utm_campaign=announcements?utm_source=wporg">GDPR and WC Vendors</a>.
* Please read our recent blog post <a href="https://www.wcvendors.com/2018/05/payments-explained/?utm_campaign=announcements?utm_source=wporg">Payments Explained</a> for solutions to your vendor commission payments. Including Stripe, Paypal and others.
* WC Vendors 2.0 is a major update, this will affect some stores using other WC Vendors integrations.
* PayPal has deprecated Adaptive Payments as of September 1st 2017. This will soon cease to function. We provide an instant payment solution via our <a href="https://www.wcvendors.com/product/wc-vendors-pro/?utm_campaign=annoucements?utm_source=wporg">Stripe Gateway</a> however there are 3rd party extensions from MangoPay and Escrow that also provide vendor commission payouts.
