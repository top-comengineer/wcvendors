The free marketplace plugin for WooCommerce.  Now you can allow anyone to open a store on your site!

== Description ==
Create your own marketplace and allow vendors to sell just like etsy, Envato, eBay, or Amazon type sites! This allows other sellers/vendors to sell tangible products, virtual products, or downloads on your site. With this plugin, your vendors receive commissions you set on products they sell from your store.

This plugin has been around since 2011 and remains still the #1 multi vendor plugin on the market.  It is the most feature packed free plugin available for operating a multi vendor store.  Many have tried to imitate, only to put all the useful features in their paid versions.  Don't fall for that trick!  Our support is top notch, check out our <a href="https://www.wcvendors.com/help/">free Help Forums</a> and notice that when you ask a question, it doesnt take a week to reply, we offer our support incredibly fast.  We are an American (Ben) and Australian (Jamie) based team of developers, and this plugin is all we do.  Give it a try!  After all, the price is right and we're here when you need us.
