## Notice

WC Vendors 2.0 is a major update. This has a brand new settings system that is not backwards compatible with the existing one. This means all extensions and plugins that interact with WC Vendors will need to be updated to support this new system.

WC Vendors 2.0 is not compatible with WC Vendors Pro 1.4.6. 

## Description
Create your own marketplace and allow vendors to sell just like etsy, Envato, eBay, or Amazon type sites! This allows other sellers/vendors to sell tangible products, virtual products, or downloads on your site. With this plugin, your vendors receive commissions you set on products they sell from your store.

WC Vendors was released to the market in October of 2014 having gotten its roots from Product Vendors by Matt Gates dating back to 2011. We are the number one multi vendor marketplace plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce. It is the most feature packed free plugin available for operating a WooCommerce based multi vendor store.
