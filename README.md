## WC Vendors 

http://www.WCVendors.com/

This is WC Vendors, a fork of Matt Gates WordPress Product Vendor plugin.

This has been forked due to the original author abandoning support for the plugin. We aim to implement bug fixes, maintain backwards compatibility and introduce new features. 

Using the ever popular WooCommerce as the basis create your own market place and support multi-vendor WooCommerce.  Start to act like envato, eBay (buy now), Amazon and more. This will allow your customers to apply to be a vendor and create their own store from within your WooCommerce store. 
	
## WC Vendors Features

Support multiple vendors on your store through a Vendor Role. 

Vendors have the following features available to them. 

* Sell physical or digital products
* Commissions on sales 
* View sales reports 
* Instant pay commissions via Paypal 
* An administration panel is available that lets the vendor setup their store details, view current orders and get sales reports. 
* Global cart ensures that the standard WooCommerce checkout stays the same as it is. This means the customer only pays once and the system handles paying the vendors behind the scenes. 
* Support is currently available for PayPal Adpative - Parallel Payments. 
* Shipping methods currently supported, no shipping, free shipping, flat rate and per product shipping. 

## Future Development

Features to be added include:
